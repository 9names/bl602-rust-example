# BL602 Rust example

A simple example program using the BL602 Rust HAL, using the serial bootloader so anyone can use Rust on their BL602-based board.  
There's no debugger support in this crate - use https://github.com/sipeed/bl602-rust-guide or a standalone debugger if you need that 

## Try it out!

If you don't have Rust and Cargo installed, install the stable toolchain using rustup from https://rustup.rs/
Rustup will prompt you for toolchain type, install location, etc. The default options are fine, and will work with this project

Once you've got Rust, open a new console/command prompt to complete the reset of the instructions

Grab the toolchain for bl602
```
rustup target add riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf
```

Install cargo-blflash
```
cargo install --locked cargo-blflash
```

Enter bootloader mode on the board by holding the boot button and pressing the en button

run
```
cargo blflash --port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

When you see  
INFO  blflash] Success  
connect to the board with a terminal emulator like putty or minicom
```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b2000000
```

then hit the en button again to run your program!
